(effect, fire, coins, life gauge icons, etc.)



In "document" folder , there are some pictures for explanation of each sprite.(These pictures are not sprite sheet.)





This asset is relation with the following asset in unity asset store.

-"Retro RPG tileset 01" asset.    (tileset asset for retro style rpg or action rpg)
-"Retro sprite font and icons" asset. (font and icons for retro style action rpg)





<caution> 

1. about pixels per unit(PPU)


In this asset , default pixels per unit(PPU) of each spritesheet is 15.9 .

If you have pixel perfect script (for camera and for each object) ,you had better change PPU from 15.9 to 16 before you begin constructing map.



2.about true color

Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 
(default setting of this asset is "true color")
